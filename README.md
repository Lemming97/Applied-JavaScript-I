169018 Applied JavaScript I

## Requirements  

```
1. Mirror the react/firebase/crud project from the book, but use it for your own spec. In other words, you'd be storing something other than messages....something useful. Think of things like Vehicle Maintenance Records
2. Create a project that gets data from Any API.
All the above must be designed, functional and have high aesthetic quality.
3. Data - 8 (How are you controlling the data? Are you using it to the best of your ability?)
4.Singular Responsibility/Professionalism - 8 (Are the Components in their own Files? How is your folder structure)
5.Functionality - 8 (Does it work?)
6.Implementation - 8 (Is a build provided?)
7.Portfolio-Worthiness (Aesthetics) - 8  What does it look like? What will people (employers) think?
```
